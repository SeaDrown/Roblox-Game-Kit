# Roblox-Game-Kit

Provides an rbxm, containing 3 folders. These folder must be ungrouped in:
-- ClientSide => (ReplicatedFirst)
-- ServerSide => (ServerScriptService)
-- ReplicatedSide => (ReplicatedStorage)

The ReferenceModule is the module used for storing services, global constants, and anything else you may need
to access from multiple scripts. This system lets the module scripts communicate with each other with little
friction.
